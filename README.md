# Medical-cost-prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting medical costs based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, region, and previous charges. The model is trained on a dataset of medical insurance records and aims to provide accurate cost estimates for healthcare services.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the `data` directory. It consists of a CSV file named `insurance.numbers.csv`, containing the following columns:
- `age`: Age of the individual in years.
- `sex`: Gender of the individual (male or female).
- `bmi`: The individual's Body Mass Index (BMI).
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
- `region`: Geographic region of the individual (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
- `charges`: Medical charges incurred by the individual.

## Model Development
The model development process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and optimization. Here's a brief overview of each step:

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values: Check for missing values in the dataset and either impute or remove them.
- Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables (e.g., sex, region) into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scale numerical features: Normalize or standardize numerical features (e.g., age, BMI) to ensure uniformity in their scales.

### Feature Engineering
- Explore feature distributions: Analyze the distribution of features and identify any outliers or anomalies.
- Create new features: Derive additional features if necessary, such as interaction terms or polynomial features, to capture complex relationships.

### Model Selection
- Choose algorithms: Select suitable machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.
- Cross-validation: Perform cross-validation to assess the performance of each model and mitigate overfitting.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Train-test split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.
- Train models: Train multiple regression models on the training data using different algorithms.
- Evaluate performance: Evaluate each model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), or R-squared.

### Model Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to improve performance.
- Regularization: Apply regularization techniques (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting and enhance model robustness.

## Model Deployment
Once the model is trained and optimized, it can be deployed in various ways, including:
- Integrating into a web application or mobile app for real-time predictions.
- Exposing as an API endpoint for remote inference.
- Packaging as a standalone application for local use.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the code:
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Conclusion
Linear regression was used and the accuracy score for this model was 75%. 


## Usage
To use the model:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
